                    <h1>Hi there! My name is Roku and welcome to my learning journal.</h1>
                    <p>After several months of learning in the Frontend Developer Career Path, I've made the big jump
                        over
                        to the Bootcamp to get expert code reviews of my Solo Projects projects and meet like-minded
                        peers.

                <h2>How I stay committed to learning</h2>
                <p>
                    I like to think of myself as a lifelong learner. I used to spend hours and hours learning, then try
                    to
                    create simple projects using what I learned or work new techniques into existing projects.</p>
                <p>
                    While that was fun, I felt like it would be helpful to share what I was learning and most things
                    about
                    my journey with the world.
                </p>
                <h2>How I got started</h2>
                <p>
                    I started simple and gradually grew my learning journal site. I would take notes about what I was
                    learning.
                    After each learning session, I'd use my notes to not only reflect on what I learned but also write
                    short
                    summaries of what I learned using my own words.
                </p>
                <p>
                    That helped me grok what I was learning, and I realized that posting my learning summaries was also
                    helping others learn and stay motivated.
